Detailed Comparative Analysis:

Compare Net Load and Gross Load trends over the years for each gauge type using line plots.
Analyze the number of wagons per train to understand its relationship with load capacity.
Efficiency Analysis:

Calculate load efficiency:
Load Efficiency = Net Load/Gross Load ×100
Load Efficiency=  Gross Load /Net Load ×100
Visualize and compare the efficiency of Broad Gauge and Metre Gauge.
Trend Insights:

Plot trends in load capacities (net and gross) over time to observe how they evolved.
Correlation Insights:

Reassess correlations between the attributes (e.g., wagons per train and load capacities) using scatter plots or detailed regressions.
